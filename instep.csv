Location: BANGALORE ( India )
                                 The idea is to explore area of intelligent automation. In traditional automation, we write
                                test scripts and give expected outcome and the scripts pass/fail as per that. However, this
                                is not very scalable approach in digital world (considering future technologies), thus we
                                need to have a way to let system learn on its own what has changed in system and what is
                                a failure and then report the failures in new system. Thus automation based on Cognitive
                                computing and Deep learning process can help here. Expected deliverable will be to create
                                a point of view, supported by a Proof of concept,on how such an automation can be achieved,
                                supported by scientific methodsThus automation based on Cognitive computing and Deep learning

                                and fit for purpose for achieving business use cases for Retail, Financial Services, Insurance
                                and many other industries. Plain vanilla open source libraries provide very good capabilities
                                in a narrow field of operation but usually require extensive training and advanced algorithms
                                to improve accuracy. The objective of this project is to provide an extensible framework
                                around these open source capabilities to improve efficiency in the overall system learning

                                 What do Dodo birds and Video Cassette Recorders have in common? Extinction. The digital
                                revolution is felt to be a threat by many across Healthcare, Life Sciences and Insurance
                                HIL industries, especially following the increase of innovative new entrants or disruptors.
                                The Project will need to evaluate whether these disrupters are threats or opportunities for
                                incumbents. It should include the hot topic of how IT Services companies, like Infosys, can
                                evolve beyond the traditional business, which IT Services players are best positioned and
                                how they re planning to capitalize on this opportunity. The Project should conclude with
                                specific disruptors across HIL industries and differentiated strategies Infosys should employ
                                to stay relevant and competitive. This project will require the intern s to intensely research
                                and engage with various teams across Infosys. There are no specific technical skill requirements,
                                but prior experience in IT Services about 3 to 5 years , understanding of MS Excel PPT and
                                most importantly ability to think out of the box, will help. The intern s will benefit considerably
                                by understanding how to anticipate and channelize disruptive forces positively. They will
                                also get a real time experience in creating building blocks of a differentiated business

Multi-user range query supported searchable encryption

Location: BANGALORE ( India )
                                 Range query based searchable encryption is a method that not only perform keyword match
                                but also facilitates range queries on encrypted data stored on a remote storage. The present
                                technologies provide mechanisms for range queries, but involve a very high overhead in data
                                storage and are applicable only on arranged data. Such databases possess high scalability
                                issues due to difficulties in data addition, modification and search. More research is required
                                to support multi-user setting. The scope of the internship includes research on the concept
                                of range queries over encrypted data on a secure but curious data store in a multi user scenario.

                                to propose a method in a multi user scenario for real time data. The intern may also develop

                                 Modern web pages can contain several hundred HTML elements, each of which can have dozens
                                of HTML and CSS style attributes that affect its rendering. Furthermore, rendering effects,
                                such as floating elements, overlays, style inheritance, and dynamic sizing, makes it difficult
                                to determine which HTML elements are responsible for an observed failure. Portions of the
                                web page that are typically checked for consistency are header, footer, left and right panels,
                                etc. These areas are expected to appear the same across all the pages in an application.
                                However, in spite of the use of templates, errors may get introduced in such areas that supposed
                                to look consistent due to several reasons. Testing of such inconsistencies in presentation
                                layer of web applications is carried manually, which is a labor-intensive and error prone
                                process. Therefore, this project conceived to automate the identification inconsistencies
                                and identify the faulty elements and correct them automatically. This project will not only
                                contribute to the research and tools, but also to the IT community, since verifying appropriate

                                is in the form of free text and is almost always unstructured. We are focusing on three projects

                                to understand the intent, gather the sentiment and to logically group the tickets based on
                                text similarity. Intent extraction and recognition from ticket description helps in identifying

                                two objects and then grouping all objects with a similar closeness The key is to extract

                                in other attributes and convert it into a structured format by using a combination of text
